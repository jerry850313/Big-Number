# Big-Number
INTRODUCTION TO COMPUTER 1 in NCU
- Introduction: We know that an integer number has 32 bits, so even using unsigned integer can only represent the maximum value of 2^32-1. Thus, we need to apply "**Big Number**" to solve this problem.

- Description: The program utilizes the concept of Arithmetic Unit in Hardware.  <br />
 The difference between the code and Arithmetic Unit is that the former computes numbers in Decimal and the latter in Binary.

- Adder Unit:
> <p>carry &nbsp in &nbsp	 9  <p/> 
> <p>input0  &nbsp &nbsp	9  <p/>
> <p>input1  &nbsp &nbsp	  9  <p/>
> <p>&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp   -------------------- <p/>
> <p>output &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp    7  <p/>
> <p>carry out &nbsp             2  <p/>
